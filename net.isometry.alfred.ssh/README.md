# ssh workflow by isometry

A workflow for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) Powerpack users to rapidly open Secure SHell (ssh) sessions with smart hostname autocompletion based on the contents of `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/hosts` and (optionally) Bonjour.

## Download
- Alfred 2 workflow: [ssh.alfredworkflow](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/ssh.alfredworkflow) (v1.3)
- Alfred 3 workflow: [ssh.alfred3workflow](https://raw.github.com/isometry/alfredworkflows/master/ssh.alfred3workflow) (v2.0)

## Prerequisites

- [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) (version 2.4+)
- The [Alfred Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).
- (optional) [pybonjour](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybonjour)

## Usage

Type `ssh` in Alfred followed by either a literal hostname or by some letters from the hostname of a host referenced in any of `~/.ssh/known_hosts`, `~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/hosts`, or (with `pybonjour` installed) Bonjour.

Alfred 3 only: workflow configuration is available by setting/changing Workflow Environment Variables (accessed via the [ùìç] button within the workflow):
- disable unwanted sources by setting the associated Workflow Environment Variable to 0; e.g. `alfredssh_known_hosts`, `alfredssh_ssh_config`, `alfredssh_hosts`, `alfredssh_bonjour`.
- change the maximum number of returned results by changing `alfredssh_max_results` (default=36).
- add additional files listing valid host completions (e.g. for pre-seeding) by adding space-separated short-name=~/file/path entries to the `alfredssh_extra_files` Workflow Environment Variable. Lines beginning with `#` are ignored, all other whitespace separated words are assumed to be valid hostnames.

If you wish to have [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) act as ssh protocol handler rather than Terminal.app, create a new iTerm2 profile with ‚ÄúName‚Äù `$$USER$$@$$HOST$$`, ‚ÄúCommand‚Äù `$$` and ‚ÄúSchemes handled‚Äù `ssh` (e.g. [here](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/28938/set-iterm2-as-the-ssh-url-handler) and [here](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/826-ssh-with-smart-hostname-autocompletion/#entry4147)).
